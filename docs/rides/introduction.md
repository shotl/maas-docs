A ride is a petition made by a passenger to travel within the Shotl system, 
regardless of whether it has been finally done or not.

## Service availability
The availability of a service is being determined by different factors:

- Zone availability
- Connected vehicles
- Service hours
- Number of passengers

The first one, service availability, can be checked through our specific endpoint, 
as it's explained [here](service-availability.md). Once you know that Shotl brings service to the given area, you will be able to start the process of a
ride schedule.
