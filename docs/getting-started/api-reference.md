The Shotl MAAS API is organized around REST. The API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts 
JSON-encoded for requests and responses, and uses standard HTTP response status codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Environments
You can use this API in sandbox mode, which does not affect live data or interact with real world. 

!!! api "Environments"
    - **Sandbox**: https://sandbox.maas.shotl.com
    - **Live**: https://maas.shotl.com

## Data
On the other hand, you'll probably need to manage some data from our dashboard site to enable vehicles, drivers, service
hours and all required configuration to be able to use the platform. Please [contact us](mailto:support@shotl.com) if you want to
receive more information about it.

## API specification
All details about endpoints are well documented in our [openapi specification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Shotl-transportation/maas/1.0.0).
These docs pretend to work as a conceptual tool to understand all our business flows and how to interact with the API as a MAAS operator.
