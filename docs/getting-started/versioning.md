## V1

The newest version of the api is v1, it can be accessed by adding the path `v1` to the host, for example: 
`http://maas.shotl.com/v1/{resource}`

Our platform is in continuous improvement, so it is possible that some changes require a new version.
We always keep our outdated endpoints for a long time to give you a great time to adapt to new features.
Of course, if we close some old endpoint, we will contact you in advance.
