We use conventional HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. 
In general: 

- 2xx indicates success
- 4xx indicates a client error
- 5xx indicates an error from our servers (not normal)

!!! tip "Working on"
    We are working to improve this section in order to inform you about the different codes included in our responses 
    to react more suitably to a possible error.
