Webhooks allow you to build or set up integrations with all events related with passengers.
When one of those events is triggered, we'll send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. 

Webhooks can be used to keep passengers involved with the latest news through 
you normally do, either by email, push notification, telephone, etc. You can create up to 1 webhook for each event.
